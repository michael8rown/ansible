Ansible for Arch

This is a collection of BASH and Ansible scripts to automate the installation of Arch Linux, install/enable GNOME extensions, install WhiteSur icons, and set a number of dconf settings the way I like them.

This is my first attempt at reproducing my NixOS experience in Arch. It isn't quite as flawless, but it's very close.
